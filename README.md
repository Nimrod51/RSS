# RSS
This python code creates an HTML dynamically from TheMarker.com RSS feed in Hebrew.

Requires FeedParser, Yattag, and lxml (all available via pip install!)

## Installation

Install the python modules listed above, and simply run 'RSS.py'. Optionally, select the required feed to be generated; otherwise simply press enter. An HTML will be saved in the same directory as your RSS.py file, and automatically opened using your default browser.
